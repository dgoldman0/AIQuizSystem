This system runs an automated quiz system. You can add questions from the admin panel. System pays out for correct answers in cryptoassets.

So requires web3 (secure - probably instead of the wallet holding a bunch of funds, it just holds enough to execute a contract to manage accounts and to dole out funds.)

Might also be good to have a log of each person's quiz. Or at least maybe a summary. Oh! A summary that's an NFT. A summary is a bit more private. Should make it clear going in that the summary becomes a publicly available NFT.
